## Description
 This is my game it's just a nightmare Tilin. Iâ€™m Anna Martinez, This is a game like Chrome Dino. You try to dodge obstacles and see how long you can last. My character is called Tilin a little egg trying to survive a bad night hinting at their death and the obstacles representing their life. The duck is their father, a Green egg is who killed them, and then the tombstone finalizes the death.

As you can see I have my egg animation running and my point counter. The obstacles and jump function are not working still.
My folder assets contain my character, obstacles, and track designs. The egg folder has Tilin's jump and walk images. The obstacles have a duck, a green egg, and a tombstone. The folder, other had a track design I was thinking of adding.

I wasn't able to get my major mechanics working in the game. The jump key would close the tab and the obstacles function wouldn't work. So next time I would like to improve my mechanics and look further into them until I find a function that will work for me. I also like to make a proper background of a forest in the middle of the night and maybe some music or sound effects as well.

## Description
 This is my game it's just a nightmare Tilin. I’m Anna Martinez, This is a game like chrome dino. You try to dodge obstacles and see how long you can last. My character is called Tilin a little egg trying to survive a bad night hinting’ of their death and the obstacles represent their life. The duck is their father, a Green egg is who killed them, and then the tombstone finalizes the death.
As you can see I have my egg animation running and my point counter. The obstacles and jump function are not working still.

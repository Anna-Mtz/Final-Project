# Finall Project Proposal

## Repository
(https://github.com/Anna-Mtz/Final-Project.git)

## Description
This will be a platformer, I will have a sprite that will jump with space, if possible an infinite amount of platforms, and a dead/game over screen with a score counter if needed.
This is relevant to media and digital art as I'm using the skills I've acquired to make digital art in a more technological way than traditional.

## Features
- Jumping
	- I will make a sprite and pygames to write a code for the character to go quickly up and straight back down with space
- infinite platforms or obstacles
	- I will make a code to allow platforms or obstacles to spawn at random until the sprite touches one.
- dead screen/score screen
	- when the sprite touches an obstacle/doesn't clear the jump a black screen will appear ending the game.

## Challenges
- How to make a sprit that jumps when the space bar is clicked.
- How to make infinite platforms or obstacles spawn.
- How to make a dead/ score scene appear.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- An ideal outcome will be when all features work as smoothly as they can and the visuals look good.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- the bare minimum outcome will be the character can jump, and some platforms appear, then an end screen of sorts.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. sprite visuals done
  2. able to jump into space

- Week 2
  1. platforms/ background visuals done
  2. The platforms can sorta move or the coding has at least started

- Week N (Final)
  1. end screen/ with a score if needed coding
  2. tune up visuals and score counter if needed
